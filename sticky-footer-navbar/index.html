    <h1 class="mt-5">What's the problem?</h1>
    <p class="lead">Fertilizers are used to provide nutrients to the soil. Nitrates and Phosphates filter in groundwater bodies.
      <br>
      This causes eutrophication which means the enrichment of water by nutrients causing the excessive growth of plants.
      <br>
      The excess of nitrogen in the water comes generally, from treatment plants.
      Nitrogen excess  shows to disrupt coral-algae symbiosis, triggering bleaching even in the absence of heat and light stress. With coral bleaching events it intensifies sea temperatures.
      <br>
      In the other hand, corals regulate the algal growth and activity by limiting their access to nitrogen. This 'blackmailing' results in algae produce energy-rich sugars, through photosynthesis for corals.
      <br>
      Diazotrophs a microbial group play a key role in maintaining the productivity of the meta-organism by supplementing it with extra nitrogen for metabolism a nd growth. However, as increasing amounts of waste water, which is full of sugars and nitrogen, are pumped into our oceans, the delicate balance of this nitrogen cycle producing  bleaching.
      <br>
       
      <b>Development</b>
      <br> 
      1.Effects of Nitrogen Excess
      Nitrogen has many consequences that can affect the coral reefs enabling the overgrowth of algae which can kill corals by smothering them, blocking their access to sunlight and promoting the growth of harmful bacteria. High levels of sediment runoff can also kill corals by suffocating them and blocking their access to sunlight.
      <br>
      <b>Importance of coral Reefs</b>
      <br>
      Reefs play an important role in protecting the shoreline from storms and surge water. Coral reefs form the backbone of local economies. In many cases, tourism is associated with reefs t expanding  the entire economy of a region. 
      <br>
      Coral Reefs protect coastlines from the damaging effects of wave action and tropical storms, they provide habitats and shelter for many marine organisms, they are the source of nitrogen and other essential nutrients for marine food chains, they assist in carbon and nitrogen fixing and finally help with nutrient recycling.
      <br>
      By their massive formation between the surface and the first few tens of meters deep, coral reefs are a very effective for absorbing elements coming from the ocean. They absorb waves energy and contribute to environmental protection through the reduction of coastal erosion. They reduce the damage in case of storms, hurricanes, and in some way, the energy of tsunamis.
      <br>
      <b>Solution</b>
      <br>

Coral reefs require the reduction of nutrients for biological functioning in the balance equilibrium, these nutrients are ammonium (NH4 +), nitrites (NO2-), nitrates (NO3-) and orthophosphates (PO43-), An increase in these can cause problems in the marine ecosystem, such as the generation of eutrophication or the creation of toxicity problems in organisms.
      <br>
At present there is a high content of nutrients in coral reefs, because the use of fertilizers has increased in the latest trends, because marine bodies are in danger. The solution proposed for the elimination of excess nutrients is the implementation of physical-chemical and biological methods in marine waters, with the use of microorganisms that have the capacity to absorb these excesses. For this, the processes that are eliminated. The first is the oxidation of ammonium and nitrite, in which the bacteria of the genus Nitrosomonas and Nitrosolobus are found, and the second is the oxidation of nitrite A nitrate, produced by the bacteria of the genus Nitrobacter and Nitrosococcus. When ammonium is oxidized to nitrate, it can be reduced to N2 by the denitrification process. In this method, the microorganisms involved are Thiosphaera, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, Paracoccus and Thiobacillus, which have the enzyme nitrate reductase, which helps reduce nitrate to nitrite; The first phase of this process is the reduction of NO3 - to NO2 -, the second is the reduction of NO2 - to NO, the third is the reduction NO to N2O, and the last one is the reduction N2O to N2.
These two biological processes represent a more viable, economic and sustainable solution to solve this problem that involves us all; However, it is in our hands.
